                        <p class="card-text">The online world is a curious but uncertain world. It enriches many facets of life but at the same time exposescitizens to a variety of threats that may cause harm to them, their loved ones and to wider society. Many of these harmsresult from a complex interaction of societal processes driven by diverse stakeholders-we call these Complex Harms. In this project, we look to provide a profound understanding of the role of online agency in protecting citizens and wil deliver collaborative methods, technological building blocksandscientifically grounded best practices for our society to provide more proactive and structured approaches to protecting citizens online. This collaborative project involves partners from Birmingham, Durham, Surrey, and Royal Holloway.

                        <p class="card-text">The pervasive presence of AI agents in socially complex settings demands a holistic understanding of human-AI interaction (HAII) and its impact on users. Beyond mere functionality, AI agent design encompasses operational dynamics and user perceptions. This project explores the sociocultural dimension of HAII, adopting an "AI-in-the-human-loop" approach that challenges the oversimplified notion of algorithmic performance. We aim to uncover the conceptual and ethical considerations underlying HAII design and evaluation, fostering theoretical advancement, empirical research, and methodological innovation. Our goal is to construct a robust conceptual framework guiding empirical studies and ensuring socially aligned AI systems. This project strives to enhance our comprehension of HAII and promote responsible, socially conscious AI design.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">The aging population poses a growing challenge for healthcare systems worldwide. Many older adults prefer to remain in their homes, but this often requires support from domiciliary/home care services. Early detection of changes in daily activity and behaviour is vital to identify when an older adult might need more support or specific intervention. Current methods of monitoring older adults at home are often limited and rely on subjective assessments or reactive interventions. Low-cost sensors and smart plugs can provide valuable data on daily activities, but these insights are limited without knowledge of the person's usual state or underlying conditions. This project aims to develop a system that combines sensor data, digital care records, and care worker insights to provide a comprehensive picture of an older adult's well-being.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Conventional user authentication methods, such as passwords and one-time passwords (OTPs), are vulnerable to compromise through theft, interception, or manipulation. While behavioural analysis techniques offer enhanced security by scrutinising user interactions and patterns, they often rely on predefined rules and static thresholds, limiting their adaptability to evolving user behaviour and emerging threats. To address these shortcomings, this research project proposes a novel user authentication system that employs reinforcement learning-driven behavioral analysis to achieve greater security and adaptability.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">One challenge with Natural Language Processing (NLP) models is their limited ability to process large texts, due to their architectural and computational constraints. To overcome this, we introduce ARElight, a system specifically designed to efficiently handle and analyse large document sequences. ARElight works by breaking down these extensive texts into segments centred around pairs of objects mentioned in the text. This segmentation enables the construction of graphs that represent the narratives within the input text. These graphs allow for various analytical operations. For instance, we can explore questions like, "How do the narratives of these texts compare?" or "What common elements do they share?". This approach is particularly effective for analysing and comparing social media accounts, observing shifts in narratives over time, and examining extensive texts such as books, offering a novel way to process and understand large-scale textual data.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">The EULA (End User License Agreement) is often a lengthy document that users commonly overlook, despite containing crucial details about data collection practices by companies. This includes information about what data is collected from users, the purposes of this collection, and how the data is shared and transferred. Notably, some companies deliberately make these documents complex to dissuade thorough reading. In our project, we aim to tackle this issue by developing an AI-powered visualisation tool. This tool is designed to automatically extract key information from user agreements and present it in a format that is easy for people to understand. The goal is to enable users to quickly grasp the essentials of what, how, and why companies collect their data, without the need to sift through long and complicated texts. This approach empowers users to make more informed decisions about their data privacy.</p>

Utilising text-based classification methods, we identify the allegiance of comment authors in the conflict and track how these narratives evolved over time under the influence of censorship. The methodology developed and the insights gained from this study are valuable for future research in this area, offering a deeper understanding of the dynamics of information warfare in today's digital era.</p>

This study explores methods to address this issue through UX disruptions. These disruptions are subtly designed to interrupt video viewing and help users regain control of their time and agency. Additionally, the study investigates the impact of such interventions on the app's machine agency, specifically examining how they affect AI recommendations and the behaviour of recommendation algorithms.</p>

Comparing GAN-photo bots to regular ones across metrics like price, survival, and trust, we surprisingly found them less sophisticated and dangerous. Cheaper, less popular, and faster, they also succumbed more readily to detection, suggesting the "cyber arms race" in GAN detection may already be leveling the playing field.

                        <p class="card-text">Though affordable smart homes promise convenience and well-being, they create hidden harm. Current research, heavily tilted towards technology, ignores users' concerns about privacy, security, and control. To fill this gap, we analyzed 235 publications (2017-2022) across diverse fields. Finding a bias towards information security and lacking user-centric studies, we urge future research to focus on how users experience, interact, and navigate the complexities of smart homes.

            <h4>Developing a Conceptual Framework for Human-AI Interaction</h4>
            <p>The ubiquitous presence of AI agents in socially intricate environments demands a comprehensive understanding of human-AI interaction (Haii) and its impact on human users. In Haii, AI design extends beyond functionality, encompassing operational dynamics and human perceptions. This project explores the sociocultural aspects of Haii, adopting a nuanced "AI-in-the-human-loop" approach. By challenging simplistic views of algorithmic performance, we aim to uncover the conceptual and ethical considerations underlying Haii design and evaluation. This endeavor is crucial for propelling theoretical, empirical, and methodological advancements. Our goal is to develop a robust conceptual framework guiding empirical studies and fostering socially responsible AI systems. Ultimately, this project strives to deepen our understanding of Haii and promote responsible AI design.</p>

            <h4>Democratising Intelligent Tutoring System Authoring with Simulated Students and Large Language Models: Embracing Human-AI Collaboration for Enhanced Teaching and Learning</h4>
            <p>Within the dynamic landscape of education, Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) have emerged as catalysts for transformation, offering personalised instruction that adapts to individual learning needs. Despite their potential to revolutionise education, traditional ITS authoring methods remain hindered by challenges such as being time-consuming, resource-intensive, and inaccessible to non-programmers. This research proposes a ground-breaking approach harnessing the power of simulated students, Large Language Models (LLMs), and human-AI interaction techniques to democratise ITS creation, elevate the learning experience, and foster exceptional student outcomes. This research aims to address the above challenges by exploring the following questions: RQ1. To what extent can simulated student based ITS authoring, empowered by LLMs, significantly reduce the time and expertise required to develop high-quality, personalised ITSs? RQ2. What strategies can be effectively implemented to integrate LLMs into the ITS authoring process, enhancing the functionality, adaptability, and effectiveness of the resulting ITSs? RQ3. What innovative human-AI interaction techniques can be adopted to optimise the user experience, accessibility, and efficiency of simulated student based ITS authoring?</p>

            <h4>Ensuring the Safety and Trustworthiness of AI Systems using Symbolic AI Techniques</h4>
            <p>The escalating reliance on AI raises concerns about reliability and trust. Issues such as mistakes, bias, and potential malicious intent underscore the need for methods to ensure the safety, reliability, and accountability of AI systems. Symbolic AI, or knowledge representation and reasoning, presents a promising approach. It offers a clear language for representing, analysing, and reasoning about system behaviour. This clarity enables the verification of models, ensuring safety and correctness. Moreover, symbolic AI provides human-understandable explanations for decisions, fostering trust in AI systems. This PhD research explores the potential of symbolic AI techniques to enhance the safety and trustworthiness of AI systems.</p>

            <h4>Exploring the Profound Influence of Artificial Social Agents on Human Interactions and Social Dynamics</h4>
            <p>AI is poised to transform the very fabric of our work, interactions, and self-perception. Artificial Social Intelligence (ASI), an emerging field of study, seeks to imbue machines with the ability to comprehend, engage, and behave in a socially intelligent and human-like manner. This PhD project aims to unravel the psychological and societal ramifications of our interactions with chatbots, virtual assistants, and AI-powered avatars. The findings will not only deepen our understanding of AI's societal impact but also provide invaluable guidance for the responsible development and deployment of these social AI systems. Furthermore, the research will contribute to the formulation of ethical frameworks and regulations within the AI industry.</p>

            <h4>Navigating the Human-AI Nexus: A Multi-faceted Approach to Responsible AI Development</h4>

            <p>Below are potential dissertation projects for Newcastle UG and MSc students.</p>
            <br>

            <h4>XAI Interactive System</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">In this project, you will create an interactive system that enables human users to evaluate and compare different types of AI explanations. Explainable AI (XAI) is a field that aims to make AI more transparent and trustworthy by providing ways to explain its decisions to humans. However, measuring the quality and usefulness of AI explanations is a challenging and open problem that requires empirical and theoretical research. You will conduct user research to understand the needs and expectations of users regarding XAI, and use the findings to inform the design and implementation of an interactive system that offers various kinds of AI explanations, such as text, image, or chat. You will test the system’s usability, effectiveness, and impact on user trust and satisfaction, using both quantitative and qualitative methods. You will also deploy the system with real users, such as AI experts, researchers, or end-users, and collect data on their experience, feedback, and trust, and use the data to improve the system.</p>

            <h4>Cybersecurity Games</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">In this project, you will design and develop a game that teaches cybersecurity skills to students in a fun and interactive way, using data science methods to create realistic scenarios and challenges, provide personalised feedback and guidance, display clear and interactive visualisations, and evaluate the learning outcomes. The game can be web-based or mobile-based, depending on your preference and skills. You will also implement a learning analytics component that monitors and analyses the learning process and outcomes of the players, using data collection, processing, and reporting tools and techniques. This component will help you understand how the players learn, what difficulties they face, what strategies they use, and how they progress and achieve the learning goals. You will also use the learning analytics component to provide feedback and recommendations to the players, as well as to improve the game design and content based on the data analysis. This project will help you learn about cybersecurity, demonstrate your data science skills, and develop your portfolio as a data scientist and a game developer. You will also have a chance to try the game with real users and get feedback and insights from them.</p>

            <h4>Visual Analytics for Digital Health</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">In this project, you will create a visual analytics system that uses data science and visualisation to help healthcare professionals and researchers analyse and understand the data from digital health systems, such as electronic records, wearables, and apps. These systems produce a lot of data that is complex, diverse, and high-dimensional, and requires effective methods to process, model, and show the data and insights in a clear and interactive way. You will identify the data sources and types for digital health systems, develop data science methods to process and model the data, such as patient outcomes, behaviour, feedback, and safety, design visualisation methods to display the data and insights in a clear and interactive way, and evaluate the usability, effectiveness, and impact of the system on healthcare decisions and research. You will also test the system with real users, such as healthcare professionals, researchers, or patients, and collect data on their experience, feedback, and decisions.</p>

            <h4>Gamified Data Science / Machine Learning Education</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">In this project, you will create a web or mobile app that teaches data science or machine learning skills to undergraduates using gamification and open student modelling. Gamification adds game elements, such as points, badges, levels, challenges, and feedback, to increase motivation and engagement. Open student modelling creates and displays representations of the student’s knowledge, skills, goals, and progress, and uses them to provide personalised and adaptive learning experiences. You will apply these methods to design and implement a gamified app that fosters the students’ intrinsic motivation and self-determination based on the self-determination theory. You will also use data science methods to create realistic data and results, display interactive visualisations, and evaluate the learning outcomes. You will collect and analyse data on the user experience, feedback, and learning outcomes, and use the data to improve the gamified app. This project will help you learn and demonstrate data science skills, and develop your portfolio as a data scientist and a gamified app developer. You will also try the app with real users and get feedback and insights from them.</p>

            <h4>Self-proposed projects are also welcome!</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">If your project is related to Machine Learning, Behavioural Analytics, Recommender Systems, User Modelling, Personalisation, Cognitive Computing, Affective Computing, Gamification, Serious Games, Participatory Design, Intelligent Tutoring Systems, etc., please let us know.</p>
