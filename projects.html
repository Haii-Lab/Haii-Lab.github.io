                        <p class="card-text">The online world is a curious but uncertain world. It enriches many facets of life but at the same time exposescitizens to a variety of threats that may cause harm to them, their loved ones and to wider society. Many of these harmsresult from a complex interaction of societal processes driven by diverse stakeholders-we call these Complex Harms. In this project, we look to provide a profound understanding of the role of online agency in protecting citizens and wil deliver collaborative methods, technological building blocksandscientifically grounded best practices for our society to provide more proactive and structured approaches to protecting citizens online. This collaborative project involves partners from Birmingham, Durham, Surrey, and Royal Holloway.

                        <p class="card-text">The pervasive presence of AI agents in socially complex settings demands a holistic understanding of human-AI interaction (HAII) and its impact on users. Beyond mere functionality, AI agent design encompasses operational dynamics and user perceptions. This project explores the sociocultural dimension of HAII, adopting an "AI-in-the-human-loop" approach that challenges the oversimplified notion of algorithmic performance. We aim to uncover the conceptual and ethical considerations underlying HAII design and evaluation, fostering theoretical advancement, empirical research, and methodological innovation. Our goal is to construct a robust conceptual framework guiding empirical studies and ensuring socially aligned AI systems. This project strives to enhance our comprehension of HAII and promote responsible, socially conscious AI design.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">The aging population poses a growing challenge for healthcare systems worldwide. Many older adults prefer to remain in their homes, but this often requires support from domiciliary/home care services. Early detection of changes in daily activity and behaviour is vital to identify when an older adult might need more support or specific intervention. Current methods of monitoring older adults at home are often limited and rely on subjective assessments or reactive interventions. Low-cost sensors and smart plugs can provide valuable data on daily activities, but these insights are limited without knowledge of the person's usual state or underlying conditions. This project aims to develop a system that combines sensor data, digital care records, and care worker insights to provide a comprehensive picture of an older adult's well-being.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Conventional user authentication methods, such as passwords and one-time passwords (OTPs), are vulnerable to compromise through theft, interception, or manipulation. While behavioural analysis techniques offer enhanced security by scrutinising user interactions and patterns, they often rely on predefined rules and static thresholds, limiting their adaptability to evolving user behaviour and emerging threats. To address these shortcomings, this research project proposes a novel user authentication system that employs reinforcement learning-driven behavioral analysis to achieve greater security and adaptability.</p>

            <h4>Developing a Conceptual Framework for Human-AI Interaction</h4>
            <p>The ubiquitous presence of AI agents in socially intricate environments demands a comprehensive understanding of human-AI interaction (Haii) and its impact on human users. In Haii, AI design extends beyond functionality, encompassing operational dynamics and human perceptions. This project explores the sociocultural aspects of Haii, adopting a nuanced "AI-in-the-human-loop" approach. By challenging simplistic views of algorithmic performance, we aim to uncover the conceptual and ethical considerations underlying Haii design and evaluation. This endeavor is crucial for propelling theoretical, empirical, and methodological advancements. Our goal is to develop a robust conceptual framework guiding empirical studies and fostering socially responsible AI systems. Ultimately, this project strives to deepen our understanding of Haii and promote responsible AI design.</p>

            <h4>Exploring the Profound Influence of Artificial Social Agents on Human Interactions and Social Dynamics</h4>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to transform the very fabric of our work, interactions, and self-perception. Artificial Social Intelligence (ASI), an emerging field of study, seeks to imbue machines with the ability to comprehend, engage, and behave in a socially intelligent and human-like manner. This PhD project aims to unravel the psychological and societal ramifications of our interactions with chatbots, virtual assistants, and AI-powered avatars. The findings will not only deepen our understanding of AI's societal impact but also provide invaluable guidance for the responsible development and deployment of these social AI systems. Furthermore, the research will contribute to the formulation of ethical frameworks and regulations within the AI industry.

            <h4>Co-Decision-Making between Humans and Machines</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">How can a small group of humans and machines collaborate in decision making? What mechanisms and frameworks are needed for humans and machines to coordinate their activities and efficiently make decisions? Is it possible to scale up these methods thus supporting massive activities? In this project, we will address these questions by exploring new forms of human-machine interaction and collaboration.</p>

            <h4>Designing Emotional Intervention Mechanisms Towards Ensuring Affective and Cognitive Quality</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">The ultimate goal of this research is to explore and implement emotional intervention mechanisms for ensuring affective and cognitive quality for distance learning that are gamified using game design strategies and game elements, by analysing and mapping relationships between key factors affecting students’ emotions and learning effectiveness, and adaptively generating and delivering personalised learning materials that can intervene students’ emotional state thus ultimately improving learning outcomes.</p>

            <p>Below are potential dissertation projects for Newcastle UG and MSc students.</p>
            <br>

            <h4>Interactive System for XAI</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">Explainable AI (XAI) refers to methods and techniques in the application of Artificial Intelligence such that the results of the solution can be understood and trusted by humans. There is a strong need for quantifiable measurements used by actual humans to assess the interpretability of AI decisions. In this project, you will develop a novel, scalable system (mobile (iOS/Android) or web-based) that supports the quantifiable assessment of AI Explanations with humans.</p>

            <h4>Concept Map to Support Cognitive Behaviour and Behavioural Changes</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">Concept Mapping has been proven to have a promising impact on learning. Some studies suggest that effective feedback, hyperlinks, expert templates, comparative strategies, etc. may support better learning behaviour. In this project, you will be developing and evaluating a mobile (iOS/Android) or web-based application providing concept mapping facilities that can help students learn more efficiently and effectively.</p>

            <h4>Games for Learning Machine Learning</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">At present, Machine Learning (ML) is among the most popular modules/courses in many undergraduate programmes in the globe. However, there are many challenges in learning ML. For example, (1) to start learning ML, it is important that a student has essential math knowledge including Equations, Functions, Graphs, Differentiation and Optimisation, Vectors and ics, Statistics and Probability and so on; (2) ML processes and many of its algorithms are very complex and abstract, thus in need of good visualisations and explanations; and (3) students normally come with diverse background (knowledge, skills, cognitive preferences) such that the “one-size-fits-all” approach does not really work. In this project, you will develop a digital game to help undergraduate students learn ML. It could be either web-based or mobile-based application. You will also evaluate the application with real users.</p>

            <h4>Self-proposed projects are also welcome!</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">If your project is related to Machine Learning, Behavioural Analytics, Recommender Systems, User Modelling, Personalisation, Cognitive Computing, Affective Computing, Gamification, Serious Games, Participatory Design, Intelligent Tutoring Systems, etc., please let us know.</p>
